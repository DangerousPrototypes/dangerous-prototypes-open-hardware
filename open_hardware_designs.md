## Welcome!

Thank you for visiting the OpenBCI Python repository. This python code is meant to be used by people familiar with python and programming in general. Its purpose is to allow programmers to interface with
OpenBCI technology directly, both to acquire data and to write programs that can use that data on a live setting, using python.

This document is a hub to give you some information about the project. Jump straight to one of the sections below, or just scroll down to find out more.

## What are we doing?

### The problem
* OpenBCI is an incredible biosensor that can be challenging to work with
* Data comes into the computer very quickly
* Complex byte streams
* Lots of things can go wrong when dealing with a raw serial byte stream
* The boards all use different physical techniques to move data to computers such as bluetooth or wifi.
