## Camera Module
  - A miniature camera sensor capable of capturing high-resolution images and videos.
  - Infrared LEDs for night vision capabilities.
  - Facial recognition software and hardware compoents.

## Microcontroller Board 
  - Embedded system with microcontroller (e.g. Arduino, Raspberry Pi) to control the camera and process data.
  - Connectivity features such as WiFi or Bluetooth for communication with other devices.

## Power Supply
  - Battery or power adapter to provide energy to the prototype.

## Enclosure:
  - 3D printed or machined casing to house all components securely.
  - Access points for camera lens, infrared LEDs, and connectivity ports.

## User Interface
  - Physical Buttons or touch sensitive panels for manual control.
  - LED indicators for status feedback(eg. power, connectivity).

## Mobile App Interface
  - A simulated mobile app or a separate device to demonstrate how users can interact with the camera through a smartphone or tablet.

## Sensors
  - Motion sensors for detecting movement and triggering recording.
  - Microphones for audio capture and communication.
